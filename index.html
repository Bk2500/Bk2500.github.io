# comment, make the background out of div boxes. Script: A man walks on the beach to find something/someone. 
Something interesting happens when he interact said object/person. He travels to a warzone or a battlefield with his fellow comrades/friends. 
The friends could be the same figure or shape as the man. Note to self is it ok to have a warzone or battle field in my animation project?
